# Background
You are working for a small fintech startup that wants to start offering banking services to its clients. At the moment, the startup only operates in Great Britain, but will immediately follow with expansion to Germany in the coming months. Your team has to build a backend service that will receive requests to open bank accounts and if the requests are valid, create that bank account.

# System under test
Requirements:
- The name of the account should be formed by the first and last name of the client separated by a space - e.g. “Jane Doe”
- The name of the account can not be longer than 50 characters
- Only people older than 18 years can open an account
- Clients can also deposit money with their request for an account and this money will serve as their starting balance.

Your team has already started building the service and have implemented 2 endpoints for you to test at https://global-bank-qa-challenge-external.fleet.dev.eu-west-1.sumup.net/
- POST /api/accounts endpoint will be used to create accounts with the following request data:
   - first_name - first name of the account holder
   - last_name - last name of the account holder
   - date_of_birth - date of birth of the account holder
   - initial_deposit - the deposit that we have received from our client in their request to open an account, which we’ll use as their starting balance
- GET /api/accounts/:id endpoint can be used to poll and check the generated IBAN when it gets created.

All endpoints are secured with the API key. 

At https://global-bank-qa-challenge-external.fleet.dev.eu-west-1.sumup.net/swagger-ui/index.html you will find the API docs.

# Task
Your task is to design and deliver tools and automation that will empower your teammates to efficiently validate and test this service. 
Your goal is to create reusable, maintainable, and configurable solution that will simplify and standardize QA processes for the team.

Specifically, your work should:

- Provide a **comprehensive suite of automated tests** to validate the system’s functionality.
- Include **supporting tooling** to be adopted by other engineers for running these tests as part of their workflow.
- Ensure that each test run produces **a clear report** summarizing results and other key details.
- Offer **a configurable setup** for setting the system’s URL and API key to support testing in multiple environments (e.g., local, staging).
- Enhance the README file with:
  - Instructions for setting up prerequisites and dependencies  
  - Steps for running the tests  
  - A list of TODOs for enhancements you would like to implement for the automation suite  
- In addition:
  - Any bugs, risks, or improvement suggestions you identify in the service should be documented in the README.

Finally, ensure your solution is committed to the provided GitHub repository and ready for collaboration.
